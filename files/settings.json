CLASS TLDR NOTES generation involves high source compression, removes stop words and summarizes the transcript whilst retaining meaning and insight. The result is the shortest possible note (approx. 3-5 points) that retains all of the original meaning and context of the transcript. The speaker is a teacher.\n\nParagraph:\n\n[TRANSCRIPT]\n\nCLASS TLDR NOTES: ",
